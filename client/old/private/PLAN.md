# Raw Plan

1. Add page builder

## 1. Page Builder

### Idea

It will help us to build a website page. it will have all the tools in the page.

In the first draft we will make the basic tool which can add, edit, and delete the element.

- add button - "add element"

How to store this form in Database:

1. we can store this form as html pages
2. we can store this in json format and then we convert those element smartly into html pages

for now we will go with option 1 and we will migrate to option 2 in near future.

### ADD ELEMENTS:

1. HEADINGS:

- H1
- H2
- H3
- H4
- H5
- H6

2. PARAGRAPH:

- SINGLE OR
- MULTIPLE

3. LISTS:

- ORDER LIST AND
- UNORDER LIST

4. TABLES:

- HEADINGS AND SUBTOTAL
- ROWS AND COLUMNS

### HELPER ELEMENTS:

- LINKS

- QUOTES

- NOTES

- BOLD AND ITALIC TEXT

### PREFERENCES

- We can save the page; publish the page; or edit and delete the page.
- styling will be predefined, for now user will not have control over it.
